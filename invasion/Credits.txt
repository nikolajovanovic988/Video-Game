created by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in
Japan, and licensed in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one
of the earliest shoot 'em ups and the first fixed shooter. The aim is to defeat waves of aliens
with a laser to earn as many points as possible.

	Designer Nishikado drew inspiration from games such as Breakout and Gun Fight and science
fiction stories such as The War of the Worlds, Space Battleship Yamato, and Star Wars. To complete
it, he designed custom hardware and development tools. Space Invaders helped expand the video game
industry from a novelty to a global industry.

	Space Invaders was an immediate commercial success. By 1982, it had grossed $3.8 billion,
[7] with a net profit of $450 million, making it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing
entertainment product of its time. Adjusted for inflation, all versions of Space Invaders are
estimated to have grossed over $13 billion in total revenue,[7] making it the highest-grossing
video game of all time.

	The game has been the inspiration for other video games and has been ported and re-released
in various forms. The 1980 Atari VCS version quadrupled the system's sales and became the first
killer app for video game consoles. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often
representing video games as a whole.
